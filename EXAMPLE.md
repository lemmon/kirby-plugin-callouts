> [!NOTE]
> Kirby callouts land in seconds—just write your Markdown and let the plugin do the polish.

> [!TIP]
> Drop key onboarding tips, pricing nudges, or release highlights right where your readers skim.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat mission-critical announcements with the weight they deserve; the Lucide icons do the heavy lifting.

> [!WARNING]
> Shipping docs without callouts is like launching features without analytics—technically possible, strategically reckless.

> [!CAUTION]
> We make styling addictive. Start with our defaults, then theme to match your brand before you go all-in.

> [!SPOTLIGHT]
> Custom callout types? Absolutely. Name it, style it, and watch your editor flow stay effortless.
