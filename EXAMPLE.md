> [!NOTE]
> Kirby callouts land in seconds; just write your Markdown and let the plugin do the polish.

> [!TIP]
> Drop key onboarding tips, pricing nudges, or release highlights right where your readers skim.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat mission-critical announcements with the weight they deserve; the Lucide icons do the heavy lifting.

> [!WARNING]
> Shipping docs without callouts is like launching features without analytics. Technically possible, strategically reckless.

> [!CAUTION]
> Style responsibly: start with our defaults, then theme to match your brand before everything demands a makeover.

> [!SPOTLIGHT]
> GitHub won't style this one, but Kirby will; custom callout types are first-class citizens here.

> This is a regular blockquote; nothing changes unless you opt in with `[!TYPE]`.
